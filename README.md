# AWS Config

It is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you assess, audit, and evaluate the configurations of your AWS resources. It provides a way to manage and track the configuration changes and compliance of your AWS environment over time. AWS Config continuously monitors the state of your resources and records configuration changes, allowing you to maintain a history of these changes and ensuring that your resources adhere to your desired configurations.

We use AWS Config to detect compliant and non-compliant ec2 instances for the below rule.

- Compliant (EC2 Instance has Monitoring enabled)
- Non-Compliant (EC2 Instance does not have Monitoring enabled)
